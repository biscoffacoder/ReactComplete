React - Open source library for building UI, not a framework.
        React is declarative, React.DOM is supposed to build on what you define.
        npx - npm package runner that gets installed when installing npm. Command to create React app - npx create-react-app fooname
        npm - when using npm alone, we need to install npm globally, command - npm install create-react-app -g, create-react-app fooname;



create react app using - npx create-react-app appname
start react app - npm start
package.json - holds all the dependencies.
if you find any npm issues like ERR:npm missing, run - npm install

index.js    - is the first page to be executed, imports ReactDOM from react-dom. App from ./App
index.html  - the single page that gets loaded from index.js reference which refers to the div id="root".
App.js      - an export functional componenet that contains the information to be rendered in index.js which in turn is being rendered in root id of index.html.

JSX         -   JavaScript XML - HTML code in JS, react transforms this into browser acceptable HTML. Extension to JS language syntax.
                React uses the decalrative approach where we define the desired target state and let React figure out the actual JS DOM instructions.
                JavaScript uses imperative approach where we clearly define all instructions that needs to be executed to generate an element.
                JSX differences - 
                1. Class -> className
                2. for -> htmlFor
                3. camelCasing - onclick->onClick, tabindex -> tabIndex

Component - Part of UI.
            2 types of Componenets - Functional componenet, Class component - 
            Functional componenet - JS functions, do not need to extend React.Component. Can return JSX/HTML
            Class Component - Class extending Conponent Class, render method returning HTML/JSX.
            We can create Functional component, Arrow functional componenet. Both of them work as expected.
            JSX code should always have only 1 root element. Workarounds can be - HOC, additional div. It uses className instead of class.
            Props - properties that can be passed out from higher componenet to children component.
            1. Functional Component -   JS function, optionally receive props, and return HTML/JSX. 
                                        Abscence of "this" keyword, uses different styles to lifecycle hooks, mainly for UI, dumb/presentational.
                                        Props are handled using props.foo Cannot change props- write to props in Components
            
            2. Class Conponent -        ES6 classes, optionally receive props and return HTML/JSX. It can use private state and maintain it.
                                        More feature rich, maintain their own private state, complex UI logic, provides lifecycle hooks, Smart/Containter.
                                        Props are handled using this.props.foo  

            Props vs State - 
            Props - props get passed to the component, function parameters, immutable, Functional components - props.foo, Class Component - this.props
            State - managed within the component, variables decalred in the function body, state can be changed, useState hook in Functional Component, this.state in Class Component.

            State in class component - Create constructor to use state - constructor(){super(); this.state={name:"Allan"}}, using the value - {this.state.name}
            Modifying the state directly without using setState does not rerender the Component, the state may change, but it'll not re-render the component. 
            setState -  To update the state in class component, we can use setState, Calls to setState are asynch. Passing a callback function makes sure that the setState is updated immediately.
                        React may group multiple setState calls into one, to adderess performance issues. This will not guarentee the updation of state using multiple setStates, in 1 cycle. ex - func(){setState//5 times}-- result / setState 5 times but state updation only once.
                        Use the function as an argument to update the state based on previous values. 2nd parameter to the setState can be props.

            Destructuring props -   Usual passing of props - (props) - Use - {props.name}.
                                    
                                    In Functional Components-
                                    Destructuring - (name) - use - {name}
                                    (props) - Destructuring - const {name,heroName}=props;

                                    In Class Conponent - 
                                    Inside render method - Destructuring - const {name,heroName}=this.props;
            
            Event Handling -
